PYNQ computer vision overlay enables networking capabilities from PL on the board.

## Getting Started
*Note: If you will need to be running Ubuntu 16.04.*

To try this project, use the following command in a terminal.

```
sudo pip3.6 install --upgrade git+https://github.com/Xilinx/PYNQ-ComputerVision.git
sudo reboot
```

After the setup, the notebook folder will be populated, and users can try
the demo there. Users do not have to run any additional steps.

*Note: For completeness, the following few sections introduce what have been done
starting from a PYNQ image V2.1 SD card. These steps do not need to be performed
by users, since they will be taken care of when this package is being installed.*
